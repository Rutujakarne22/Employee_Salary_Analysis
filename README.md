## Problem Statement  
The HR and payroll departments maintain large volumes of employee salary data, but the raw format often contains inconsistencies, blanks, duplicates, and poor structure. Without proper data organization, data teams struggle to derive timely and accurate reports for management decisions.

This project aims to transform raw payroll data into a clean, structured, and interactive Excel dashboard that supports HR executives and management in identifying salary trends, employee counts, high-cost roles, and workforce distribution across job types and salary categories.

## Objective  
To clean, analyze, and visualize employee salary data using Excel so that decision-makers and HR analysts can understand pay distribution, identify high-earning roles, monitor workforce types, and support compensation planning.

## Recommendations  
- Evaluate the concentration of salary spending in public-facing roles for budgeting.  
- Review pay structures for lower earners making up nearly one-third of the workforce.  
- Use the dashboard filters to analyze trends by year, role, or employment type for better HR planning.  
- Improve data collection standards to reduce time spent on cleaning and formatting.
